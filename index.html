                <p>
                    In April 1955, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) established the European Cup,
                    however, the English league winners, Chelsea, were denied entry by the Football League's secretary,
                    Alan
                    Hardaker,
                    who believed not participating was best for English football.
                    The following season, the English league was won by Manchester United, managed by Matt Busby.
                    The Football League again denied their champions entry, but Busby and his chairman, Harold Hardman,
                    with the help of the Football Association's (FA) chairman Stanley Rous,
                    defied the league and United became the first English team to play in Europe.

                <h3>Crash</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Thain had flown the "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador (registration G-ALZU) to Belgrade but
                    handed the controls to Rayment for the return.
                    [23] At 14:19 GMT, the control tower at Munich was told the plane was ready to take off and gave
                    clearance for take-off,
                    expiring at 14:31.[24] Rayment abandoned the take-off after Thain noticed the port boost pressure
                    gauge fluctuating as the plane reached full
                    power and the engine sounded odd while accelerating.[25] A second attempt was made three minutes
                    later, but called off 40 seconds into the attempt

                <hr>
                <p>
                    The crash was originally blamed on pilot error, but it was later found to have been caused by slush
                    towards the end of the runway, slowing the aircraft and preventing safe flying speed.[56] During
                    take-off,
                    the aircraft had reached 117 knots (217 km/h), but, on entering the slush, dropped to 105 knots (194
                    km/h),
                    too slow to leave the ground, and with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with
                    tail-wheel
                    undercarriages had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages
                    in relation
                    to the aircraft's centre of gravity,[notes 1]

                <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Twenty people, including seven of Manchester United's players, died at the scene of the crash. The
                    21st victim was Frank Swift,
                    a journalist and former goalkeeper who played with Busby at Manchester City; he died on his way to
                    hospital. Duncan Edwards died
                    from his injuries on 21 February at the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich, and the final death toll
                    reached 23 several days later
                    when co-pilot Rayment died as a result of serious head injuries.[28] Johnny Berry and Jackie
                    Blanchflower were both injured so
                    severely that they never played again.[59] Busby was seriously injured and had to stay in hospital
                    for more than two months after
                    the crash, and was given the Last Rites twice.[60]
