* ### Features left to implement

## Design
   * I have used used a black & white as the main theme for this website. This reflects the time period the topic is on and resonates with the sombre tone of the event.
   * The text colour of white was chosen as it correlates with the them and is easy to read with the dark backdrop
   
<br>
   
## Technologies Used
   * HTML5
   * CSS3
   * Google Fonts: To import font family 'Bitter' & 'Oswald' into the the style.css file. Added fallback font sans-serif.
   * Font Awesome: Was used in footer for social media links  for asthetic and UX purposes.

<br>
   
## Further Testing
   * I have tested that the navigation links in the header all work correctly and take you to the correct section of the page
   * I have tested that the links underline when hovered over 
   * I have tested that the external social media links in the footer all work
   * I have tested that the first name, last name and email are all required in order to submit the form
   * I have tested that the submit button changes colour when hovered over

## Solved Bugs
   * When testing on safari I realised the navigation links in the header were bunched to the right on medium sized screens. Clear: both; was added to the media query to fix this
   
   * When testing on mobile devices I realised the form section was encroaching on the footer. This was fixed by removing the height of the footer
   
   * When testing on mobile devices I realised the content in the overview section was too and crowded. I fix this by setting text-align to justify
   
   <br>
   
   ## Deployment 
* The site was deployed to Github pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
   * Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
   * In the Github repository, navigate to the settings tab
   * Under the code and automation subsection, select the pages tab
   * Once the main branch has been selected and saved, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate successfull deployment.
